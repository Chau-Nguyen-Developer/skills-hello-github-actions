## Notes
* Workflows have jobs, and jobs have steps.  
* Each step consists of either a shell script that is executed, or a reference to an action that is run. When we talk about an action in this context, we mean a reusable unit of code.   
* An action is a pre-defined, reusable set of jobs or code that perform specific tasks within a workflow.
